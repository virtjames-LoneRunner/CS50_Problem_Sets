CS50 FINAL PROJECT: SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a very simple School Management System that includes a number of pages like, a home page, faculty members page, an about page, a contact page, and pages for individual articles, most of which access the data they display from various databases. 

More importantly, this web app includes different dashboards for different users which are the students, their parents, faculty, staff, and the admin, all with different capabilities that match to the role of the user.

Example features:

    The admin can access the databases partaining to the faculty, staff, student, and parents. The login page for the admin is hidden from the actual login page.

    The login page is the same for all roles, except for the admin, and simply asks the user for the role he/she wishes to login as, and this is handled at the back end.

    The staff can add/enroll accounts to the database through their dashboard.

    The faculty has access the student's database.

    The student has access to his/her own data, and is simply viewed on the dashboard.

    The parent also has access to their children/s data.

    The index of the page pulls data from a database to display them in the home section, it displays data on updates made by student-journalists, current school offers, information on pricing, and a list of the faculty and staff.

    Data on the dashboards are dynamically added using JQuery to optimize load times and offer a more dynamic experience.

    All the users have the capability to change their passwords via the link in their dashboards.
